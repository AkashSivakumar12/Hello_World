# Hello_World
First Repository
This is gonna be my first time using GitHub. A repo is basically just the code i guess, and you can branch out of the main to merge again later if needed, or keep it different
Trying out mark up syntax 
**Using the double asterix makes text bold in between**
*Using just one makes it italics*
> this makes block quote whatever that is
use this `to type in code needed` in the middle of the ``
to add links
  use [hello_there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc)
  where the link is between the () and the title is in between []
use one hashtag fr h1, 2 for h2, 3 for h3
# h1
## h2
### h3
If u need any more use this
